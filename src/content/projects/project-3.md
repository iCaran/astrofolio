C++ implementation for calculating the real-time dynamics of a 6DOF RSS (Rotational Spherical Spherical) manipulator using symbolic computation with GiNaC.

Controlling a complex robotic arm with six degrees of freedom requires efficient computation of its dynamics. This project focuses on simplifying and solving the symbolic Jacobian matrices, which are crucial yet computationally intensive components for real-time control.
